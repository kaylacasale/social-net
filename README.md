# social-net
A social networking application created via an API where users can create accounts that store information, share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and add friends. This demonstrates calling third-party HTTP-based APIs using JavaScript frameworks from a MERN stack application.

This application uses Express.js to establish routes, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and DayJS to format timestamps. All seed data except for basic user ingo was created using Postman.

## NoSQL: Social Network API
In developing this application, I utilized the MERN stack, working with React to implement the presentation layer (front-end), Express.js and Node.js to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB (via Mongoose) to create the database layer(back-end).

Social media technology has offered us greater convenience and connectivity. Staying connected with family and friends worldwide via email, FaceTime, etc. has never been so accessible. Along with this- quick access to information and research, online learning, job skills, content discovery, and opportunities for remote employment are all benefits of social media APIs. 

Social-Net allows users to dynamically create, delete, and update user information such as thoughts posted, reactions, friend lists, etc.
